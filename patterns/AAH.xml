        <description>
	    A sample of student work is quickly reviewed to gain a high-level appreciation of quality,
	    common mistakes and ommissions. This pattern is a pre-cursor to other marking and
	    feedback activities. It does however provide a quick way to gauge the general level of
	    attainment in the body of work.
	</description>
        <applicability>
	    Useful in providing very fast turn-around feedback - as part of iterative refinement
	    and multiple submissions. Or as a precursor to other feedback activities.
	</applicability>
        <consequences>
	    By its very nature, this approach does not provide any detailed feedback.
	    Direct relevance to specific student's work is therefore limited
