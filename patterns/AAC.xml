        <description>
            Face-to-face group discussion of the produced work, involving both
            tutor and other students in the deconstruction and analysis.
            Should ideally focus on both postive and negative (room for improvement)
            aspects of the work.
        </description>
        <applicability>
	    Works well with a close-knit group of trusting students.
	    Seems fairest in group of students with similar level of ability.
	</applicability>
        <consequences>
	    Can result in the demotivation of poor performing students.
	    Can lead to conflict between students if not managed carefully.
	</consequences>
