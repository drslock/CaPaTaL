        <description>
	    A sample solution is created by "cherry picking" the best elements from a range of student submissions.
	    The composite solution provides a clear and concrete indication of best practice.
	    It should however be pointed out that this may not be a "perfect" solution, just the "best in class"
	</description>
        <applicability>
	    Works well with a convergent exercise, where the samples selected are relevant to all students.
	</applicability>
        <consequences>
	    Lack of coherence in the composite sample solution can sometimes confuse less able students.
	    Can lead to competition between students (who will be selected for inclusion in the sample solution)
	</consequences>
